CSE445 (Machine Learning) Research Project
<br>
This was my CSE445 course's project. Here we used 3 machine learning models to predict the best trading entry points on bank stocks listed on DSE. We obtained accuracy as high as 82% on the random forest model. I am in short of time hence I am not going to extend this readme file about our features and how we calculated it yada yada. If you are interested, have a look at the jupyter notebooks or message me.<br>

<b>We were a 3 member team, so I would definitely not take full credits for this project. <b> I was incharge of data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, feature calculations and handling all the works related to the dataset. Creating the models and training them were done by Shafkat and Sazid.
