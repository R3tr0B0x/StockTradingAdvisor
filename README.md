CSE445 (Machine Learning) Research Project
<br>
This was my CSE445 course's project. Here we used 3 machine learning models to predict the best trading entry points on bank stocks listed on DSE. We obtained accuracy as high as 82% on the random forest model. I am not going to extend this readme file about our features and how we calculated it yada yada. If you are interested, have a look at the jupyter notebooks or you are most welcome to send me a message on telegram: @R3tr0B0x<br>

<b>We were a 3 member team. </b><br>
